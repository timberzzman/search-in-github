## üìñ Configuration

Before you can install and use the project, you need to define some environment variables in .env file.

You need one .env file in each subdirectory.

For the client, the variables are :

```dotenv
# This is the api url, wich are the server address
API_URL=""
```

üí°  A version of the server are actually available at [https://webmdmfs1-search-in-github.herokuapp.com/](https://webmdmfs1-search-in-github.herokuapp.com/)

For the server, the variables are :

```dotenv
# 
DATABASE_URL=""
# This is a github token, wich are actually mandatory, maybe not later
GITHUB_TOKEN=""
# The port your server should be listening (optional)
PORT=
```

‚ö†Ô∏èYou need to set the environment variables before going to the next step. If not, the project might not working.
